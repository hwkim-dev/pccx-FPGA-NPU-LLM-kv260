# FPGA Release Evidence Checklist

This checklist defines the minimum evidence required before tagging any
production release of `pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260`.  Complete source-only
snapshots (e.g. `v0.1.0-alpha`) do not require all items; hardware-gated
items are marked **[HW]**.

See also: [`RELEASING.md`](../RELEASING.md) for the tagging process,
and [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) for the version under preparation.

---

## 1. Implementation completion

- [ ] All P0/P1 GitHub issues resolved or explicitly deferred with rationale
- [ ] Known TODOs listed in release notes (copy from open issues)
- [ ] No uncommitted user work (`git status` clean on tagged SHA)
- [ ] Version and commit hash recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` cut
- [ ] `CITATION.cff` metadata consistent with tag

---

## 2. Simulation evidence

For each testbench run include the following.  Current TB inventory:
`tb_barrel_shifter_BF16`, `tb_ctrl_npu_decoder`, `tb_FROM_mat_result_packer`,
`tb_GEMM_fmap_staggered_delay`,
`tb_GEMM_dsp_packer_sign_recovery`, `tb_GEMM_weight_dispatcher`,
`tb_mat_result_normalizer`, `tb_mem_u_operation_queue`,
`tb_shape_const_ram`.

- [ ] Command used to run: `cd hw/sim && bash run_verification.sh`
- [ ] Vivado / xsim version recorded (currently: Vivado v2025.2)
- [ ] Per-TB pass/fail summary from the deterministic runner
- [ ] Known warnings or elaboration errors documented
- [ ] `.pccx` trace artifacts retained in `hw/sim/work/<tb>/`
- [ ] Waveform snapshots (`.wdb`) retained for failed TBs
- [ ] E2E NPU_top integration TB added and green (tracked: [#37](https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/issues/37))
- [ ] BF16-to-INT8 preprocess golden-model TB added (tracked: [#33](https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/issues/33))

---

## 3. Synthesis evidence

Existing post-synthesis reports: `hw/build/reports/` (tool: Vivado v2025.2,
date: 2026-04-20, design: NPU_top, device: xck26-sfvc784-2LV-c).

- [x] Synthesis run completed and summary recorded (utilization, timing,
      DRC, clocks)
- [x] Vivado version recorded in report headers
- [ ] Target clock and achieved slack documented in release notes
  - Current post-synth: `core_clk` WNS = **−9.792 ns** (NOT MET, 4194 failing
    endpoints); `axi_clk` WNS = +2.253 ns (MET).  Post-synthesis slack is
    pessimistic; post-implementation timing is the authoritative figure.
  - Post-synthesis utilization snapshot: 5 611 LUTs, 8 458 FFs, 80 RAMB36,
    56 URAM, 4 DSP (GEMM systolic array not yet fully instantiated).
- [ ] DRC critical violations resolved or documented
- [ ] Constraints file (`hw/constraints/`) referenced in release notes
- [ ] Clock interaction report reviewed for `core_clk` / `axi_clk`

---

## 4. Post-implementation and timing closure evidence

**[HW]** These items require a full Vivado implementation run (tracked:
[#29](https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/issues/29),
[#42](https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/issues/42)).

- [ ] Implementation run completed (route_design)
- [ ] Post-route timing summary: WNS / TNS / failing endpoints
- [ ] Timing constraints met for both `core_clk` (target 400 MHz) and
      `axi_clk` (target 250 MHz)
- [ ] Utilization post-implementation recorded
- [ ] Clock interaction post-implementation recorded
- [ ] Critical path summary noted in release notes
- [ ] Bitstream evidence recorded (`.bit` not committed to git — attach to GitHub
      Release or record SHA + generation command)

---

## 5. KV260 bring-up evidence

**[HW]** None of these items are satisfied as of v0.1.0-alpha.  Do not
claim bring-up success until all mandatory items are checked.

- [ ] Board revision and serial number recorded
- [ ] Vivado / Vitis version used for bitstream generation
- [ ] Bitstream path and SHA256 recorded
- [ ] Boot sequence steps documented (JTAG / SD / network boot)
- [ ] UART or JTAG console output captured at load time
- [ ] AXI-Lite register read/write test passing (loopback or status poll)
- [ ] Observed behavior documented (with log excerpt)
- [ ] Failure modes and recovery steps noted if bring-up was not clean

---

## 6. Runtime / inference evidence

**[HW]** Only to be collected after KV260 bring-up is confirmed.  Do not
include estimated or simulated numbers as hardware-measured results.

- [ ] Model configuration used (model name, weight source, quantization config)
- [ ] Input sample documented (token IDs or prompt excerpt)
- [ ] Output sample documented (decoded tokens)
- [ ] Measurement method for latency/throughput (cycle counter, wall clock,
      UART timestamp)
- [ ] Measured tok/s figure with methodology note
- [ ] Power / thermal notes if available (board PSU measurement or on-chip
      sensor)
- [ ] Known limitations listed (sequence length cap, unsupported ops, etc.)

---

## 7. Reproducibility

- [ ] Exact `run_verification.sh` command and expected runtime noted
- [ ] Required Vivado version and license type documented
- [ ] Required hardware (KV260 board revision) listed
- [ ] Known non-reproducible parts identified (e.g. Vivado seed, licensed
      model weights)
- [ ] Steps for contributor to reproduce simulation without hardware noted
      in README or a `docs/SIMULATION.md` page

---

## 8. Release gate summary

A tag **MUST NOT** be created unless:

1. All non-`[HW]` items above are checked.
2. `[HW]` items are either checked **or** explicitly deferred with a
   written rationale in the release notes.
3. `repo-validate` and `Sail typecheck` CI are green on the tagged SHA.
4. `RELEASING.md` pre-flight checklist is complete.
5. Release notes state clearly: timing closure status, bitstream
   availability, and bring-up status.

**No production release before full implementation + evidence collection.**
`v0.2.0` is the earliest realistic target; see EPIC
[#43](https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/issues/43).
