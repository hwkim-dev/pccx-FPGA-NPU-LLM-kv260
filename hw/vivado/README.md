# Vivado build for pccx v002 — KV260

This directory drives the RTL → bitstream flow for the pccx v002 NPU.
Target device: **Kria KV260 SOM, `xck26-sfvc784-2LV-c` (ZU5EV)**.

## Files

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `filelist.f`            | Ordered SystemVerilog source list, read by both `xvlog -f` and the Vivado TCL. |
| `create_project.tcl`    | Build the Vivado project (part, sources, includes, XDC). |
| `synth.tcl`             | Out-of-context synthesis of `NPU_top`. Reports into `build/reports/`. |
| `impl.tcl`              | Opt / place / route / `write_bitstream`. Long job — only run once synth is clean. |
| `build.sh`              | Wrapper: `./build.sh {project\|synth\|impl\|clean}`. |
| `npu_core_wrapper.sv`   | Plain-signal shim around `NPU_top`'s SV-interface ports, used by the BD / IP packager. |

## Quick start

```bash
cd hw

# Create the project (fast)
./vivado/build.sh project

# Out-of-context synthesis (minutes to tens of minutes, depending on machine)
./vivado/build.sh synth

# Full implementation + bitstream (hour-scale)
./vivado/build.sh impl

# Wipe all generated state
./vivado/build.sh clean
```

## What is and isn't covered

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| RTL compile (`xvlog`) — 52 files | ✅ clean |
| `xelab` on `GEMV_top`, `CVO_top`, `GEMM_systolic_top` | ✅ clean |
| `xelab` on `NPU_top` standalone | ⚪ expected fail — interface ports need a wrapper; see `npu_core_wrapper.sv` |
| `create_project.tcl` | ✅ runs green |
| `synth.tcl` (out-of-context) | 🟡 first real smoke test — see `build/reports/` for the outcome of the current run |
| `impl.tcl` (write_bitstream) | 🔴 not attempted yet — gated on synth being warning-free |
| Block design / Zynq PS integration | 🔴 not written yet (see §Next steps) |
| Device-tree overlay | 🔴 not written yet |
| Driver smoke test on board | 🔴 not attempted yet |

## Next steps to reach a running board

1. **Synth clean** — resolve whatever `synth.tcl` turns up in
   `build/reports/drc_post_synth.rpt` and the Vivado log. Common
   first-pass issues to expect:
   - unresolved `XPM_*` references needing `-L xpm` in synth
   - untied output ports on placeholder modules
   - multi-driver or ambiguous interface modport warnings
2. **Block design** — create `vivado/system_bd.tcl` that drops:
   - Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC IP (KV260 preset)
   - `npu_core_wrapper` as a packaged IP
   - AXI Interconnect / Smart Connect between PS HP/HPC/HPM and the NPU
   - Clock Wizard for the 400 MHz core clock
3. **`write_bitstream`** — only run after (1) and (2) are green; otherwise
   you burn an hour for nothing.
4. **Device-tree overlay** — see `sw/dtbo/` (to be created) for the
   Ubuntu 22.04 FPGA Manager flow. Files: `pccx_npu.dtsi`,
   `shell.json`, `Makefile`.
5. **KV260 deploy**:
   ```bash
   sudo xmutil unloadapp
   sudo cp build/pccx_v002_kv260.bit.bin \
           sw/dtbo/pccx_npu.dtbo \
           sw/dtbo/shell.json \
           /lib/firmware/xilinx/pccx_npu/
   sudo xmutil loadapp pccx_npu
   dmesg | tail -30     # look for successful overlay + no AXI timeouts
   ```
6. **Driver smoke** — `sw/driver/` is still skeleton per the repo's
   implementation-status table; bring that up in parallel with the
   board-side work.

## Phase A placeholders still in effect

These do not block synth but make the board-side behaviour non-functional.
Flagged in `tools/phase0/phase_A_audit.md` on the docs repo:

- `GEMM_systolic_top.sv` truncates the 27-bit BF16 mantissa to 8 bits
  as a placeholder for the real PREPROCESS → INT8 path.
- No drain-every-1024 counter yet; the packer's 21-bit per-channel
  accumulator can overflow on long GEMM tiles.
- Weight streamer / DMA upstream of `GEMM_weight_dispatcher` does not
  yet emit two INT4 lanes per row pair — the plumbing exists, the
  source content still has to be organized.
